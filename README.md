NFTs are a new technology that will have a profound impact in how people collaborate, problem solve and do communitary work.
They provide the possibility to create a token to represent something completely abstract, or even real, and freely trade them.
All sorts of virtual contracts can be associated to them, but where this technology really shines and brings new opportunities, is in its ability to trace back ownership all the way from the current state to its creation.

This technology could create a completely creative sandbox where artists, tech developers and even scientist could tokenize and post unfinished work, projects and results. Their ownership over those can always be certified by the blockchain, and if anyone else in the same field is interested in using, reproducing or even building upon that work and results, the virtual contracts could automatically make sure that all copyright and intellectual property are automatically and effortlessly shared between the involved.

However, where the NFT technology will make the biggest impact is on the humanitarian field.
Think about a world where making a donation to a charity could be seen as an investment, and at the same time an investment could also be a donation and a gesture of charity.
This sounds like a completely utopian world, but the NFT technology can bring this utopia into reality.

Imagine a platform where any human being in the world that can bring some value into society could make a donation of that value into the world without first converting it into money, with the possibility of cashing that value back in the future. NFTs allow us to do that, and the vision of the NFTs for Humanity project is to bring this dream into reality.

The concept of this project is to create a completely free and communitary platform where anyone in the world could make donations in any form to any charity or social program in the world. These donations would be tokenized, and these tokens can then be "sold" in a free market where anyone that wishes to donate to that cause could make a donation by buying those tokens. If in the future that person needs that money back, they could always try to sell those tokens back to someone else who supports the same ideas.

This could create a market of donations and a cascade effect of good, since the more people donate and the more friends you bring to donate with you, the more your tokens will be valuable, like in any free market. Of course, that similarly to any free market, there will be greedy people willing to speculate for pure profit, but that is actually a wonderful thing. The more micro transactions involved in this system, the more royalties will be generated, and the more money will go into the charities.

As I truly believe that there are still at least few purely autruistic people out there in the world, I assume that a market like this would slowly and continuously grow over time, meaning the the earlier people donate, the most money they will make. And that is a complete utopia that NFTs can bring to reality.

This is the vision, the goal and the dream of the NFTs for humanity project and I here invite any human being on the planet to contribute to make this dream come true.
