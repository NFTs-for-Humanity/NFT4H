NFTs for Humanity

NFTs are a new technology that will have a profound impact on how people
collaborate, solve problems and do community work. They enable the creation
of a token that can represent anything, abstract or real, and freely trade it. All
sorts of virtual contracts can be associated with NFTs, but the highlight and
innovation of this new technology is its ability to trace back ownership of the
token all the way back to its creation.

This technology could create a completely creative sandbox where artists,
entrepreneurs, developers and even scientists could tokenize and post
unfinished work, projects, products and results that can always be certified by
blockchain. And if anyone else in the same field is interested in using,
reproducing or even building upon those works and results, the virtual contracts
could automatically make sure that copyright and intellectual property are
automatically and effortlessly shared between all the parties involved.

However, it is on humanitarian aid that the NFT technology can make the
biggest impact. Think about a world where making a donation to a charity could
be seen as an investment and, reversely, an investment could also be a
donation and a gesture of charity. This sounds like a completely utopian world,
but the NFT technology can make this utopia come true.

Imagine a platform where any human being that can bring some value into
society could make a donation of that value to the world without monetizing it
first, but keeping the possibility of cashing back on it in the future. NFTs allow
us to do that, and the vision of the NFTs for Humanity project is to bring this
dream into reality.

The concept of this project is to create a completely free and communal
platform where anyone could make a contribution in any form to any charity or
social program of their choosing. These contributions would be tokenized, and
these tokens could then be &quot;traded&quot; in a free market where anyone who wishes
to donate to that cause could do it by buying those tokens. If in the future that
person needs that money back, they could always try to sell those tokens back
to someone else who supports the same ideas. For example, a painter could
contribute a painting to a charity of his choosing. Anyone that wishes to help
that charity could buy the tokens associated to that artwork, and the money
would go directly and entirely to the charity.

This new technology is able to transform any resource available to humanity into a commodity.
Since the world volume of transactions involved in donations is over 400 billion dollars annually and this platform is highly encrypted, all transactions can be made with extremely low risks of fraud. Morover, all donors will be gifted with artwork from artists that believe in the same causes as them.
Therefore, there is absolutely no reason not to do at least a large part of these donations through the NFT platform.

This could create a market for contributions and a cascade effect of goodwill. As
more people contribute and their friends donate, their tokens become more
valuable, like in any free market that is growing. This new technology is able to transform any resource available to humanity into a commodity.
As these commodities will be traded in a free market it will attract speculators, willing to buy and trade donations in an open market.
The more microtransactions involved in this system, the more
royalties will be generated, and the more money will go to the charities and
even back to whoever made the original contribution in the first place.
This market will follow patterns similar to other cryptocurrencies and form aggresive bubbles that will be able to raise vast amounts of resources to charity.

We truly believe that there are still selfless and generous people out there, so I
assume that a donation market like this would slowly but continuously grow over
time. This would mean that the earlier you donate, the more money you can
make. It would be the same as investing in humanity. That is a complete utopia
that NFTs can bring to reality!

NFTs are a new technology that allows humanity to turn any resource that has any intrinsic value in it and trade it in a free market where there are people willing to buy those commodities and people willing to speculate over these commodities.

This is the vision, the goal and the dream of the NFTs for Humanity project and
we here invite any human being on the planet to contribute to make this dream
come true.
